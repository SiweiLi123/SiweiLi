    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>I once believed that people were defined by their status for their entire lives, but now I understand that everyone has a meaningful foundation upon which they can build to make a significant impact on the world. My name is Siwei, and I am a high school student and athlete aspiring to become a software engineer and entrepreneur. I plan to achieve this by developing my skills in coding and business and building meaningful relationships with my peers so that we can work together toward shared goals. When I become a software engineer, I hope to collaborate with others and solve problems for society through code.</p>
    
    <p>In middle school, I hated running. But during the summer before high school, I trained to achieve something I never thought possible a year earlier: breaking through my limits. I trained for the most challenging endurance event—the marathon. All summer, every morning, I pushed myself, running distances I never imagined possible. When I felt beaten down from training, I found motivation in knowing that thousands of others were doing the same, building a community of people who endure challenges for the better. Two months later, crossing that finish line alongside thousands of others was the best feeling I’d ever had.</p>
    
    <p>Why did I do it? Why put myself through all that training just to run for a few hours on a random day? To me, the training proved that I can take on arduous challenges without fearing the outcome. Too many people avoid doing things they want because they fear failure. But the only true failure is not trying—if you keep working toward something, you’ll only move closer to success. I apply this mindset to other areas of my life, like getting good grades, supporting my school team, and becoming the best version of myself.</p>
